# steganography-QRcode

Problem Statement 13
__________________
Given any image file input.png, hide a QR code in it, not visible to naked eyes, and generate the image file output as output.png,
where the QR code image is generated by the program using the secret code user input (secret code can be any random string of length 6-14 example "my_secret") 
(Program A). Then write another program to extract the QR code from the image  (Program B). (Hint: Stenography)

<ol>
<li>Installing relevant packages - <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
<li>Run encryptImage.py to encrypt an image. Save the image to be encrypted in the same directory as 'input.png'</li>
<li>An 'output.png' would be generated which has the QR code hidden in it.</li>
<li>Run decryptImage to get the QR code and the secret text contained in it.</li>
<li>'decodedQR.png' contains the decrypted image. 'exp.png' contains the cropped QRcode used for getting the secret text from the QRcode</li>
</ol>
